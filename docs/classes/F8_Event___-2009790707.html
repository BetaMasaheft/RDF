These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.<br /><br />Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the ‘Neolithic Period’, the ‘Ming Dynasty’ or the ‘McCarthy Era’. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.<br /><br />There are two different conceptualisations of “artistic style”, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, ‘Impressionism’ can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.<br /><br />Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.<br /><br />[This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]<br /><br />[Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment, and E65 Creation are indirect subclasses of E4 Period = F8 Event; as a consequence, F8 Event is an indirect superclass of: F27 Work Conception, F28 Expression Creation, F40 Identifier Assignment, F41 Representative Manifestation Assignment, F42 Representative Expression Assignment, F32 Carrier Production Event, F33 Reproduction Event, and F30 Publication Event]<br /><br />Examples:<br />The battle of Trafalgar<br /><br />Printing for the publisher named ‘Doubleday’ in 2003 all the copies of the first print run of the novel entitled ‘Da Vinci Code’ (F32)<br /><br />Having the initial idea that eventually resulted in the existence of the opera entitled ‘Der fliegende Holländer’ (F27)<br /><br />Creating for Mozart’s 41st symphony the uniform title that was thereafter consistently used to refer unambiguously to that symphony everywhere in the Library of Congress’s catalogue (F40)<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span></li>
