It is possible that in an instance of E10 Transfer of Custody there is either no donor or no recipient. Depending on the circumstances it may describe:<br />1. the beginning of custody<br />2. the end of custody<br />3. the transfer of custody<br />4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source<br />5. the declared loss of an object<br /><br />The distinction between the legal responsibility for custody and the actual physical possession of the object should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). A specific case of transfer of custody is theft. The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody is in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing. For instance, in the case of a set of cutlery we may require the majority of pieces having been in the hands of the actor regardless which individual pieces are kept over time. <br /><br />The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- the delivery of the paintings by Secure Deliveries Inc. to the National Gallery<br />- the return of Picasso's "Guernica" to Madrid's Prado in 1981<br /><br />In First Order Logic:<br />E10(x) ⊃ E7(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in a Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.<br /><br />If the instance of the E29 Design or Procedure utilized for the modification prescribes the use of specific materials, they should be documented using property P68 foresees use of (use foreseen by): E57 Material of E29 Design or Procedure, rather than via P126 employed (was employed in): E57 Material.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- the construction of the SS Great Britain (E12)<br />- the impregnation of the Vasa warship in Stockholm for preservation after 1956<br />- the transformation of the Enola Gay into a museum exhibit by the National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC between 1993 and 1995 (E12, E81)<br />- the last renewal of the gold coating of the Toshogu shrine in Nikko, Japan<br /><br />In First Order Logic:<br />E11(x) ⊃ E7(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered "new" if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered "new" because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.<br /><br />This entity can be collective: the printing of a thousand books, for example, would normally be considered a single event.<br /><br />An event should also be documented using E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities and matter is preserved, but identity is not.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- the construction of the SS Great Britain<br />- the first casting of the Little Mermaid from the harbour of Copenhagen<br />- Rembrandt's creating of the seventh state of his etching "Woman sitting half dressed beside a stove", 1658, identified by Bartsch Number 197 (E12,E65,E81)<br /><br />In First Order Logic:<br />E12(x) ⊃ E11(x)<br />E12(x) ⊃ E63(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

All the attributes or properties assigned in such an action can also be seen as directly attached to the respective item or concept, possibly as a collection of contradictory values. All cases of properties in this model that are also described indirectly through an action are characterised as "short cuts" of this action. This redundant modelling of two alternative views is preferred because many implementations may have good reasons to model either the action or the short cut, and the relation between both alternatives can be captured by simple rules.<br /><br />In particular, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain museum procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on if this information should be accessible by structured queries.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- the assessment of the current ownership of Martin Doerr's silver cup in February 1997<br /><br />In First Order Logic: <br />E13(x) ⊃ E7(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

An E15 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents, which themselves may be instances of E41 Appellation. The syntax and kinds of constituents to be used may be declared in a rule constituting an instance of E29 Design or Procedure.<br /><br />Examples of such identifiers include Find Numbers, Inventory Numbers, uniform titles in the sense of librarianship and Digital Object Identifiers (DOI). Documenting the act of identifier assignment and deassignment is especially useful when objects change custody or the identification system of an organization is changed. In order to keep track of the identity of things in such cases, it is important to document by whom, when and for what purpose an identifier is assigned to an item.<br /><br />The fact that an identifier is a preferred one for an organisation can be expressed by using the property E1 CRM Entity. P48 has preferred identifier (is preferred identifier of): E42 Identifier. It can better be expressed in a context independent form by assigning a suitable E55 Type, such as "preferred identifier assignment", to the respective instance of E15 Identifier Assignment via the P2 has type property.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- Replacement of the inventory number TA959a by GE34604 for a 17th century lament cloth at the Museum Benaki, Athens<br />- Assigning the author-uniform title heading "Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.<br /><br />We model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.<br /><br />The CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- the Cullinan Diamond (E19)<br />- the cave "Ideon Andron" in Crete (E26)<br />- the Mona Lisa (E22)<br /><br />In First Order Logic:<br />E18(x) ⊃ E72(x)<br />E18(x) ⊃ E92(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.<br /><br />Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.<br /><br />As the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.<br /><br />Whether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.<br /><br />Consequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.<br /><br />We model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.<br /><br />There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.<br /><br />Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Jurassic<br />European Bronze Age<br />Italian Renaissance<br />Thirty Years War<br />Sturm und Drang<br />Cubism<br /><br />In First Order Logic: <br />E4(x) ⊃ E2(x)<br />E4(x) ⊃ E92(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.<br /><br />Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities.

A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.<br /><br />It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.<br /><br />Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.<br /><br />Examples:<br />- the extent of the UK in the year 2003<br />- the position of the hallmark on the inside of my wedding ring<br />- the place referred to in the phrase: "Fish collected at three miles north of the confluence of the Arve and the Rhone"<br />- here -&gt; &lt;-<br /><br />In First Order Logic:<br />E53(x) ⊃ E1(x)"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of an instance of E54 Dimension. If the true values belong to a non-discrete space, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values.

Persistent Items can be either physical entities, such as people, animals or things, or conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or common names. <br /><br />The criteria that determine the identity of an item are often difficult to establish -; the decision depends largely on the judgement of the observer. For example, a building is regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter.

This allows you to describe the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. In the case of an E26 Physical Feature the default reference space is the one in which the object that bears the feature or at least the surrounding matter of the feature is at rest. In this case there is a 1:1 relation of E26 Feature and E53 Place. For simplicity of implementation multiple inheritance (E26 Feature IsA E53 Place) may be a practical approach.<br /><br />For instances of E19 Physical Objects the default reference space is the one which is at rest to the object itself, i.e. which moves together with the object. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.<br /><br />This property is a subproperty of P161 has spatial projection because it refers to its own domain as reference space for its range, whereas P161 has spatial projection may refer to a place in terms of any reference space. For some instances of E18 Physical Object the relative stability of form may not be sufficient to define a useful local reference space, for instance for an amoeba. In such cases the fully<br />developed path to an external reference space and using a temporal validity component may be adequate to determine the place they have occupied.<br /><br />In contrast to P156 occupies, the property P53 has former or current location identifies an instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time span.

These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard the corresponding expression as equivalent to one Individual Work.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Abstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 1st state’<br /><br />Abstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 2nd state’ [explanation: these are two states of the same etching, but with so many and so significant differences between them that they can scarcely be recognised as conveying the same work; more generally speaking, each individual state of an etching, as a Self-Contained Expression, conveys its own F14 Individual Work (even if the differences are not so blatant as in the case of ‘Carcere XVI’), and is regarded as part of the larger, abstract F15 Complex Work that encompasses all distinct states of the same etching]<br /><br />Abstract content of the recording made of performances of Johann Sebastian Bach’s ‘Toccata in C minor BWV 911’ by Glenn Gould on May 15 & 16, 1979, in Toronto, Eaton’s Auditorium		<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

In practice, no clear line can be drawn between parallel and subsequent processes in the evolution of a work. One part may not be finished when another is already revised. An initially monolithic work may be taken up and evolve in pieces. The member relationship of Work is based on the conceptual relationship, and should not be confused with the internal structural parts of an individual expression. The fact that an expression may contain parts from other work(s) does not make the expressed work complex. For instance, an anthology for which only one version exists is not a complex work.<br /><br />The boundaries of a Complex Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. Thus, derivations such as translations are regarded as belonging to the same Complex Work, even though in addition they constitute an Individual Work themselves. In contrast, a Work that significantly takes up and merges concepts of other works so that it is no longer dominated by the initial concept is regarded as a new work. In cataloguing practice, detailed rules are established prescribing which kinds of derivation should be regarded as crossing the boundaries of a complex work. Adaptation and derivation graphs allow the recognition of distinct sub-units, i.e. a complex work contained in a larger complex work.<br /><br />As a Complex Work can be taken up by any creator who acquires the spirit of its concept, it is never finished in an absolute sense.<br />Examples:<br />Work entitled ‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ by Auguste Rodin<br /><br />Work entitled ‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare<br /><br />Work entitled ‘Der Ring der Nibelungen’ by Richard Wagner<br /><br />Work entitled ‘Carceri d’invenzione’ by Giovanni Battista Piranesi<br /><br />Work entitled ‘Mass in B minor BWV 232’ by Johann Sebastian Bach<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The substance of Work is concepts. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously or over time. A Work may have members that constitute components of the overall concept or that are alternatives to other members of the work. Members of a work may or may not represent the concept of the Work as a whole; for instance a translation reinterprets the whole, a volume of a trilogy represents a part of the concept.<br /><br />A Work can be either individual or complex. If it is individual its concept is completely realised in a single F22 Self-Contained Expression. If it is complex its concept is embedded in an F15 Complex Work. An F15 Complex Work consists of members that are either F15 Complex Works themselves or F14 Individual Works. The member relationship of Work is based on the members respecting the same concept, and should not be confused with the structural parts of an expression, that might be taken from other work(s).<br /><br />A Work is the product of an intellectual process of one or more persons, yet only indirect evidence about it is at our hands. This can be contextual information such as the existence of an order for a work, reflections of the creators themselves that are documented somewhere, and finally the expressions of the work created. As ideas normally take shape during discussion, elaboration and implementation, it is not reasonable to assume that a work starts with a complete concept. Moreover, it can be very difficult or impossible to define the whole of the concept of a work at some given time. The only objective evidence for such a notion can be based on a stage of expressions at a given time. In this sense, self-contained expressions serve as a kind of “snap-shots” of a work.<br /><br />A Work may aggregate expressions of other works into a new expression. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Abstract content of Giovanni Battista Piranesi’s ‘Carcere XVI: the pier with chains: 1st state’ (F14)<br /><br />‘La Porte de l’Enfer’ by Auguste Rodin conceived between 1880 and 1917 (F15)<br /><br />‘Hamlet’ by William Shakespeare (F15)<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

This implies that the incorporated expressions (such as the text of the staged play, the text of the argument for the ballet, the recorded music to be used for the ballet, or the content of the musical score to be used for a concert, etc.) are not by themselves a part of the expression of this F1 Work. Rather, an expression (F25 Performance Plan) of the instructions the stage production, choreography or musical performance consists of incorporates (R14) that textual or musical content. In other words, the text of ‘Hamlet’ is not a component of the concepts that underlie a given mise-en-scène of ‘Hamlet’, but any staging directions (F25 Performance Plan) that convey a given director’s vision of ‘Hamlet’ must necessarily incorporate the text of ‘Hamlet’.<br /><br />Examples:<br />The conceptual content of Sergei Radlov’s mise-en-scène of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’ in Moscow in 1935<br /><br />The conceptual content of Pina Bausch’s choreography of the ballet entitled ‘Rite of spring’ in Wuppertal in 1975<br /><br />The conceptual content of Bruno Walter’s performance of Gustav Mahler’s 9th symphony in 1961<br /><br />The conceptual content of the “performance handbook” for Luigi Nono’s musical work entitled ‘À Pierre’<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The quality of wholeness reflects the intention of its creator that this expression should convey the concept of the work. Such a whole can in turn be part of a larger whole.<br /><br />Inherent to the notion of work is the completion of recognisable outcomes of the work. These outcomes, i.e. the Self-Contained Expressions, are regarded as the symbolic equivalents of Individual Works, which form the atoms of a complex work. A Self-Contained Expression may contain expressions or parts of expressions from other work, such as citations or items collected in anthologies. Even though they are incorporated in the Self-Contained Expression, they are not regarded as becoming members of the expressed container work by their inclusion in the expression, but are rather regarded as foreign or referred elements.<br /><br />F22 Self-Contained Expression can be distinguished from F23 Expression Fragment in that an F23 Expression Fragment was not intended by its creator to make sense by itself. Normally creators would characterise an outcome of a work as finished. In other cases, one could recognise an outcome of a work as complete from the elaboration or logical coherence of its content, or if there is any historical knowledge about the creator deliberately or accidentally never finishing (completing) that particular expression. In all those cases, one would regard an expression as self-contained.<br /><br />Examples:<br />The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the authoritative critical edition La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4)<br /><br />The musical notation of Franz Schubert’s lied known as ‘Ave Maria’<br /><br />The musical notation of Franz Schubert’s lieder cycle entitled ‘Seven Songs after Walter Scott’s The Lady of the Lake’, of which ‘Ave Maria’ is a distinct part<br /><br />The musical notation of Franz Liszt’s piano transcription of Franz Schubert’s lied known as ‘Ave Maria’<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

Joly, overall layout, etc.; a special, shunting sound was added at the end of side one and beginning of side two, as Terry Riley’s work is in the form of a continuous musical flow without any interruption and the technical possibilities of vinyl LPs did not allow the complete performance to be contained on just one side: that special, shunting sound was not intended in Riley’s score nor in the performance but was added by the publisher (with or without Riley’s consent, this detail is not documented), and as such it is part of the Publication Expression although it is not part of the composer’s and the performers’ Self-Contained Expression (this shunting sound was no longer needed in subsequent releases on CD)<br /><br />The overall content of the DVD entitled ‘The Aviator (2-Disc Full Screen Edition)’, released in 2004: Martin Scorsese’s movie itself; layout of the box and the two DVDs contained in the box; pictures on the DVDs themselves; English, Spanish, and French subtitles; English and French audio tracks; and bonuses: commentaries by director Martin Scorsese, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, and producer Michael Mann; a deleted scene (‘Howard Tells Ava About His Car Accident’); and featurettes ‘A Life Without Limits: The Making of The Aviator’; ‘The Role of Howard Hughes in Aviation History’; ‘Modern Marvels: Howard Hughes, A Documentary by the History Channel’; ‘The Visual Effects of The Aviator’; ‘The Affliction of Howard Hughes: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder’; ‘The Age of Glamour: The Hair And Makeup of The Aviator’; ‘Costuming The Aviator: The Work of Sandy Powell’; ‘Constructing The Aviator: The Work of Dante Ferretti’; ‘An evening with Leonardo DiCaprio and Alan Alda’; ‘OCD Panel Discussion With Leonardo DiCaprio, Martin Scorsese, and Howard Hughes’ Widow Terry Moore’; ‘Still Gallery’; ‘Scoring The Aviator: The Work Of Howard Shore’; and ‘The Wainwright Family – Loudon, Rufus and Martha’<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

This class characterises the externalisation of an Individual Work.<br /><br />Although F2 Expression is an abstract entity, a conceptual object, the creation of an expression inevitably also affects the physical world: when you scribble the first draft of a poem on a sheet of paper, you produce an F4 Manifestation Singleton; F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the carrying E18 Physical Thing. The work becomes manifest by being expressed on a physical carrier different from the creator’s mind. The spatio-temporal circumstances under which the expression is created are necessarily the same spatio-temporal circumstances under which the first F4 Manifestation Singleton is produced. The mechanisms through which oral tradition (of myths, tales, music, etc.) operates are not further investigated in this model. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only those instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s mind and the auditor’s mind are taken into account (for a discussion of the modelling of oral traditions, see: Nicolas, Yann. ‘Folklore Requirements for Bibliographic Records: oral traditions and FRBR.’ In: Cataloging & Classification Quarterly (2005). Vol. 39, No. 3-4. P. 179-195).<br /><br />Examples:<br />The creation of the original manuscript score of ‘Uwertura tragiczna’ by Andrzej Panufnik in 1942 in Warsaw<br /><br />The reconstruction from memory of the manuscript score of ‘Uwertura tragiczna’ by Andrzej Panufnik in 1945 after the original score was destroyed during the war<br /><br />The recording of the third alternate take of ‘Blue Hawaii’ performed by Elvis Presley in Hollywood, Calif., Radio Recorders, on March 22nd, 1961 [each individual take is a distinct instance of F2 Expression]<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The substance of F2 Expression is signs.<br /><br />Expressions cannot exist without a physical carrier, but do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. Carriers may include human memory.<br /><br />Inasmuch as the form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression, any change in form (e.g., from alpha-numeric notation to spoken word, a poem created in capitals and rendered in lower case) is a new F2 Expression. Similarly, changes in the intellectual conventions or instruments that are employed to express a work (e.g., translation from one language to another) result in the creation of a new F2 Expression. Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the resulting F2 Expression is considered to be a new F2 Expression. Minor changes, such as corrections of spelling and punctuation, etc., are normally considered variations within the same F2 Expression. On a practical level, the degree to which distinctions are made between variant expressions of a work will depend to some extent on the nature of the F1 Work itself, and on the anticipated needs of users.<br /><br />The genre of the work may provide an indication of which features are essential to the expression. In some cases, aspects of physical form, such as typeface and page layout, are not integral to the intellectual or artistic realisation of the work as such, and therefore are not distinctive criteria for the respective expressions. For another work features such as layout may be essential. For instance, the author or a graphic designer may wrap a poem around an image.<br /><br />An expression of a work may include expressions of other works within it. For instance, an anthology of poems is regarded as a work in its own right that makes use of expressions of the individual poems that have been selected and ordered as part of an intellectual process. This does not make the contents of the aggregated expressions part of this work, but only parts of the resulting expression.<br /><br />If an instance of F2 Expression is of a specific form, such as text, image, etc., it may be simultaneously instantiated in the specific classes representing these forms in CIDOC CRM. Thereby one can make use of the more specific properties of these classes, such as language (which is applicable to linguistic objects only).<br /><br />Examples:<br />The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Divina Commedia’ as found in the authoritative critical edition ‘La Commedia secondo l’antica vulgata a cura di Giorgio Petrocchi’, Milano: Mondadori, 1966-67 (= Le Opere di Dante Alighieri, Edizione Nazionale a cura della Società Dantesca Italiana, VII, 1-4) (F22)<br /><br />The Italian text of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ as found in the same edition (F22)<br /><br />Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita	<br />mi ritrovai per una selva oscura	<br />ché la diritta via era smarrita [the Italian text of the first stanza of Dante’s ‘Inferno’ and ‘Divina Commedia’] (F23)<br /><br />The signs which make up Christian Morgenstern’s ‘Fisches Nachtgesang’ [a poem consisting simply of “-” and “˘” signs, arranged in a determined combination] (F22)<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

Such an event includes the creation of an F24 Publication Expression and setting up the means of production. The end of this event is regarded as the date of publication, regardless of whether the carrier production is started. Publishing can be either physical or electronic. Electronic publishing is regarded as making an instance of F24 Publication Expression available in electronic form on a public network. Electronic Publishing does not mean producing a physical F5 Item by partially electronic means. Making an electronic file available on a physical carrier can be regarded as equivalent to setting up the means of production; downloading the file is regarded as the electronic equivalent of F32 Carrier Production Event.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Publishing Amerigo Vespucci’s ‘Mundus novus’ in Paris ca. 1503-1504<br /><br />Establishing in 1972 the layout, features, and prototype for the publication of ‘The complete poems of Stephen Crane, edited with an introduction by Joseph Katz’ (ISBN ‘0-8014-9130-4’), which served for a second print run in 1978<br /><br />Making available online the article by Allen Renear, Christopher Phillippe, Pat Lawton, and David Dubin, entitled ‘An XML document corresponds to which FRBR Group 1 entity?’ http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2003/Lawton01/EML2003Lawton01.html<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

Any individual performance (with or without intermissions) is a single instance of F31 Performance.

A complete run of performances may comprise an original run plus any of its extensions and tours.<br /><br />Note that a performance plan may be more or less elaborate, and may even foresee just improvisation.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Performing the first performance of a Yiddish translation of the textual work entitled ‘King Lear’, as directed by Sergei Radlov, in Moscow, at the Moscow State Jewish Theatre, on February 10, 1935 [individual performance]<br /><br />Performing the ballet entitled ‘Rite of spring’, as choreographed by Pina Bausch, in Avignon, at the Popes’ Palace, on July 7, 1995 [individual performance]<br /><br />Performing the operatic work entitled ‘Dido and Aeneas’, as directed by Edward Gordon Craig and conducted by Martin Shaw, in London, Hampstead Conservatoire, on May 17, 18, and 19, 1900 [run of performances]<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The creation of a new copy of a file on an electronic carrier is also regarded as a Carrier Production Event.<br /><br />Typically, the production of copies of a publication (no matter whether it is a book, a sound recording, a DVD, a cartographic resource, etc.) strives to produce items all as similar as possible to a prototype that displays all the features that all the copies of the publication should also display, which is reflected in property R27 used as source material F24 Publication Expression.<br /><br />Examples:<br />The printing of copies of the 3rd edition of ‘Codex Manesse: die Miniaturen der großen Heidelberger Liederhandschrift, herausgegeben und erläutert von Ingo F.

A Reproduction Event results in new instances of E84 Information Carrier coming into existence. In general, the copy will have different attributes from the original and they are therefore not regarded as siblings.<br /><br />This class makes it possible to account for the legal distinction between private copying for the purpose of “fair use,” and mass production for the purpose of dissemination.<br /><br />It can prove difficult to determine where to draw the line between F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event in cases where multiple copies are produced. In this case, the copies, but not the original, may be regarded as instances of F5 Item. It is the existence of an explicit production plan that makes the difference. As a consequence, F33 Reproduction Event and F32 Carrier Production Event are not declared as disjoint, which makes it possible to account for such situations that could be regarded as instances of both Production Event and Reproduction Event.<br /><br />Examples:<br />My photocopying now for my own private use an exemplar of the article entitled ‘Federal Court’s Ruling Against Photocopying Chain Will Not Destroy “Fair Use”’ by Kenneth D.

An instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type defines all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item normally display in order that they may be recognised as copies of a particular publication. However, due to production problems or subsequent events, one or more instances of F5 Item may not exhibit all these features or traits; yet such instances still retain their relationship to the same instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type.<br /><br />The features that characterise a given instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type include: one instance of F24 Publication Expression, containing one or more than one instance of F2 Expression, reflecting the authors’ content of the manifestation and all additional input by the publisher; and the appropriate types of physical features for that form of the object. For example, hardcover and paperback are two distinct publications (i.e. two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation Product Type) even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications. The activity of cataloguing aims at the most accurate listing of features or traits of an instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type that are sufficient to distinguish it from another instance of F3 Manifestation Product Type. In this sense, it may be said that a typical bibliographic record for a publication (not a manuscript) reflects the notion of F3 Manifestation Product Type.<br /><br />Examples:<br />The publication product containing the text entitled ‘Harmonie universelle’ (authored by the person named ‘Marin Mersenne’), issued in 1636 in Paris by the publisher named ‘Sébastien Cramoisy’<br /><br />The publication product containing a modern reprint of Marin Mersenne’s ‘Harmonie universelle’, issued in 1986 in Paris by the publisher named ‘Les éditions du CNRS’, and identified by ISBN ‘2-222-00835-2’<br /><br />The publication product containing the third edition of the combination of texts and graphics titled ‘Codex Manesse: die Miniaturen der großen Heidelberger Liederhandschrift, herausgegeben und erläutert von Ingo F.

An F40 Identifier Assignment may include the creation of the identifier from multiple constituents. The syntax of the identifier and the kinds of constituents to be used in constructing it may be declared in a rule. The construction of controlled access points for the names of persons, families and corporate bodies following specific cataloguing rules is a typical library application. F40 Identifier Assignment also includes the assignment of uniform titles as controlled access points for works or expressions<br /><br />Examples:<br /><br />Assigning the name heading 'William, Prince, Duke of Cambridge, 1982-' as a controlled access point for a personal name using the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition<br /><br />Assigning the name heading 'Library and Archives Canada' as an authorised controlled access point for a corporate body name using the Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, 2nd edition<br /><br />Assigning the name heading 'Bibliothèque et Archives Canada' as an authorised controlled access point for a corporate body name using the Règles de catalogage anglo-américaines, 2e édition<br /><br />Assigning the author-title heading ‘Goethe, Johann Wolfgang von, 1749-1832.

These bounds are a mere approximation of the actual process of growth, spread and retreat. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area as a sedentary culture.<br /><br />Typically this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the ‘Neolithic Period’, the ‘Ming Dynasty’ or the ‘McCarthy Era’. There are however no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.<br /><br />There are two different conceptualisations of “artistic style”, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, ‘Impressionism’ can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.<br /><br />Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.<br /><br />[This is the Scope note for E4 Period in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]<br /><br />[Note that in CIDOC CRM, E12 Production, E13 Attribute Assignment, and E65 Creation are indirect subclasses of E4 Period = F8 Event; as a consequence, F8 Event is an indirect superclass of: F27 Work Conception, F28 Expression Creation, F40 Identifier Assignment, F41 Representative Manifestation Assignment, F42 Representative Expression Assignment, F32 Carrier Production Event, F33 Reproduction Event, and F30 Publication Event]<br /><br />Examples:<br />The battle of Trafalgar<br /><br />Printing for the publisher named ‘Doubleday’ in 2003 all the copies of the first print run of the novel entitled ‘Da Vinci Code’ (F32)<br /><br />Having the initial idea that eventually resulted in the existence of the opera entitled ‘Der fliegende Holländer’ (F27)<br /><br />Creating for Mozart’s 41st symphony the uniform title that was thereafter consistently used to refer unambiguously to that symphony everywhere in the Library of Congress’s catalogue (F40)<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of immobile objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.<br /><br />It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.<br /><br />Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a section of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination. [Scope Note for E53 Place in CIDOC CRM version 5.0.1]<br /><br />Note that Places may be determined by the location of historical or contemporary objects, geographic features, events or geo-political units.<br /><br />Examples:<br />The area referred to as ‘Lutèce’<br />The area referred to as ‘verso of the title page of the Library of Congress’s copy of the 1st edition of the novel entitled ‘Da Vinci Code’<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>

The title of a Work may not be one taken from a representative expression.<br />A given work can have more than one representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions are not deemed “substantial.” If the anticipated needs of users are not considered to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work, then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20).<br />A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which reads ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’, and the language of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects (e.g., the title proper ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’ itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as “representative” for Shakespeare’s work, will require the use of a uniform title).<br />R40 has representative expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50B was assigned by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Walt Whitman’s textual work titled ‘Leaves of Grass’ (F15) R40 has representative expression the linguistic, English content of the 1892 edition, known as the deathbed edition, of Walt Whitman’s textual work titled ‘Leaves of Grass’ (F2)<br /><br />Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F15) R40 has representative expression the notational content of the 1809 edition of Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F2)<br /><br />Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F15) R40 has representative expression the sonic content of the recorded performance of Beethoven’s 5th symphony by the Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Herbert von Karajan in Berlin in November 1982 (F2)<br /><br />The series titled ‘Nancy Drew Mysteries’ (F18) R40 has representative expression The overall content provided by publisher named ‘Armada’ in one volume belonging to that series, including, among other elements, the series title page, which states that the title of the series reads ‘Nancy Drew Mysteries’ (F24)<br /><br />The periodical titled ‘The New Courier’, released by UNESCO, and described by the National Library of France in a bibliographic record that contains the following statement: “Notice réd. d’après le n° d’octobre 2002” (i.e., “description based on the issue dated October 2002”) (F18) R40 has representative expression The overall content of the October 2002 issue of UNESCO’s periodical titled ‘The New Courier’ (F24)<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span>&nbsp;</li>
