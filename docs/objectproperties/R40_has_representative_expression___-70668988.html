The title of a Work may not be one taken from a representative expression.<br />A given work can have more than one representative expression, provided the differences between these expressions are not deemed “substantial.” If the anticipated needs of users are not considered to call for bibliographic distinctions between variant expressions of a work, then even expressions that differ significantly from each other can be regarded as equally representative for the work. (See FRBR: Final Report, p. 19-20).<br />A given expression can be deemed representative for a work with regard to some of its aspects (e.g., the text contained in an edition the title proper of which reads ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’, and the language of that text), and not representative for it with regard to some other aspects (e.g., the title proper ‘The tragicall historie of HAMLET Prince of Denmarke’ itself, which, being different from the title that is regarded as “representative” for Shakespeare’s work, will require the use of a uniform title).<br />R40 has representative expression is a shortcut of the more developed path F1 Work R50B was assigned by F42 Representative Expression Assignment R51 assigned F2 Expression.<br /><br />Examples:<br />Walt Whitman’s textual work titled ‘Leaves of Grass’ (F15) R40 has representative expression the linguistic, English content of the 1892 edition, known as the deathbed edition, of Walt Whitman’s textual work titled ‘Leaves of Grass’ (F2)<br /><br />Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F15) R40 has representative expression the notational content of the 1809 edition of Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F2)<br /><br />Beethoven’s 5th symphony (F15) R40 has representative expression the sonic content of the recorded performance of Beethoven’s 5th symphony by the Berliner Philharmoniker conducted by Herbert von Karajan in Berlin in November 1982 (F2)<br /><br />The series titled ‘Nancy Drew Mysteries’ (F18) R40 has representative expression The overall content provided by publisher named ‘Armada’ in one volume belonging to that series, including, among other elements, the series title page, which states that the title of the series reads ‘Nancy Drew Mysteries’ (F24)<br /><br />The periodical titled ‘The New Courier’, released by UNESCO, and described by the National Library of France in a bibliographic record that contains the following statement: “Notice réd. d’après le n° d’octobre 2002” (i.e., “description based on the issue dated October 2002”) (F18) R40 has representative expression The overall content of the October 2002 issue of UNESCO’s periodical titled ‘The New Courier’ (F24)<br />		"</span> <span style='color: black;'>@en</span></li>
